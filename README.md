Secure Authentication System.

Implemented a user authentication system with secure login and registration functionality. Users should be able to sign up for an account, log in securely, and access protected routes(/home) only after successful authentication. I have used jwt web tokens. The password hashing used is bcrypt. For styling purposes, I have used materialize and font awesome.
